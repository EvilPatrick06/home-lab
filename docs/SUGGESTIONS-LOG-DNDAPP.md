**Triage rule:** `Domain: dnd-app` design-gotchas / future-ideas / info → here. `Domain: both` entries that meaningfully apply to dnd-app behavior → mirrored here AND in `BMO-SUGGESTIONS-LOG.md`. Cross-tooling rules that touch dnd-app contributors → here (and mirror in BMO file if it touches them too).

New entries go at the TOP of their section (newest first).

# Future ideas

> **2026-06-10 — Backlog consolidated.** All previously-open entries (incl. the
> still-open residuals of the 2026-05-18 phase-plan absorption: Phase 33a backup
> migration framework, 33c ModalScaffold, 33d bundle-size CI guard — and the
> Phase 15 library-invariant observation) became the numbered phase plans under [`../dnd-app/docs/phases/`](../dnd-app/docs/phases/) (start at [`PHASE-INDEX.md`](../dnd-app/docs/phases/PHASE-INDEX.md)); the consolidating audit was deleted once the phase set was authored (2026-06-11). Add new
> dnd-app ideas below as they appear.

### Slim the narration prompt's tag instructions once structured extraction is the default (PHASE-23 follow-up)

**Type:** future-idea · **Domain:** dnd-app · **Added:** 2026-06-16

PHASE-23 added opt-in two-call structured extraction (`aiDm.structuredExtraction`), but
the narration prompt keeps its `[STAT_CHANGES]`/`[DM_ACTIONS]` instructions in ALL modes
(forking the system prompt by config + regressing DM board actions, which extraction
doesn't cover, was not worth it now). Once `structuredExtraction: 'always'` is the
default AND `getRepairJsonStats().modified` stays at zero across releases, removing the
tag-emission instructions from `prompt-sections/*` + retiring `repairJson` becomes
worthwhile (retirement criteria live in `src/main/ai/AI_ACTION_CONTRACT.md`). Depends on
PHASE-27 extending the extraction verb set to cover board actions first.
