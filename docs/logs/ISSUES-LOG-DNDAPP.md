**Routing:** Bug / debt / config / perf / test failure scoped to `dnd-app/` (TS/React/Electron/Vite/biome/vitest/Pixi/peerjs/the 5e JSON content set) → here. `Domain: both` cross-cutting entries → mirror in BOTH `BMO-ISSUES-LOG.md` AND this file (small duplication is intentional; one fix removes both copies).

### [2026-06-29] dnd-app/mobile Dependabot npm-deps bump fails `npm ci` — package-lock.json out of sync with package.json

- **Category:** config
- **Severity:** medium
- **Domain:** dnd-app
- **Discovered by:** Claude Code (ci-failure-triage)
- **During:** hourly CI-failure triage — caught NEW failed runs 28361279932 + 28361282816

**Description:**
The grouped Dependabot branch `dependabot/npm_and_yarn/dnd-app/mobile/npm-deps-ac88f8a546` (HEAD `b6ef2973`) fails the **dnd-app mobile CI** workflow at the `setup-node-project` step. `npm ci` aborts because the committed `dnd-app/mobile/package-lock.json` does not match the bumped `package.json`: npm reports dozens of `Missing: ... from lock file` packages, e.g. `typescript@5.9.3`, `react-native-worklets@0.8.3`, and the `@babel/*@7.29.7` toolchain (`@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-typescript`, `@babel/helper-compilation-targets`, transform plugins, etc.). `npm ci` requires the lockfile and manifest to be perfectly in sync and will not write the lockfile, so it exits 1.

**Reproduction (if bug):**
1. Check out `dependabot/npm_and_yarn/dnd-app/mobile/npm-deps-ac88f8a546` (commit `b6ef2973`).
2. `cd dnd-app/mobile && npm ci`.
3. Observed: `npm error Missing: typescript@5.9.3 from lock file` (+ many more) → exit code 1; CI red on both run 28361279932 and 28361282816.

**Expected behavior (if bug):** Dependabot's group bump should update `package-lock.json` alongside `package.json` so `npm ci` installs cleanly and CI passes.

**Hypothesis / root cause:** Dependabot regenerated `dnd-app/mobile/package.json` for the grouped `npm-deps` update but the committed lockfile was not fully regenerated for the new transitive tree (the new `@babel/*@7.29.7` + `typescript@5.9.3` + `react-native-worklets@0.8.3` resolutions are absent from `package-lock.json`). Not a build/breaking-change failure — purely a lockfile-sync mismatch. Confined to the Dependabot branch; master is unaffected.

**Proposed fix / improvement:**
- [ ] `cd dnd-app/mobile && npm install` (NOT `npm ci`) on the Dependabot branch to regenerate `package-lock.json`, then commit the lockfile to the branch — or close the PR and let Dependabot recreate it with a synced lock.
- [ ] Confirm none of the grouped bumps (`typescript@5.9.3`, `react-native-worklets@0.8.3`, `@babel/*@7.29.7`) are major/breaking before merge; if a major bump is in the group, that part is a human decision (per AUTOMATED-AGENT-GIT-WORKFLOW Rule 3B).
- [ ] Re-run dnd-app mobile CI; merge via the integrator once green.

**Blocked by:** Owned by the integrator's Dependabot-PR review path (AUTOMATED-AGENT-GIT-WORKFLOW Rule 3B). ci-failure-triage did not commit to the Dependabot branch (not its branch; Dependabot may rebase/force-push it).

**Integrator review [2026-06-29, integrator]:** Reviewed under Rule 3B. Lockfile is *not* the real blocker — `cd dnd-app/mobile && npm install` regenerates `package-lock.json` cleanly (1210 pkgs, exit 0) and biome lint passes. After the regen, `tsc --noEmit` fails with **one** breaking error: `app.config.ts(27,3): error TS2353: 'splash' does not exist in type 'ExpoConfig'`. This grouped bump is a **full Expo SDK major upgrade** — `expo ~56.0.12`, `@expo/config-types ^56.0.6`, plus `typescript ~6.0.3` and `@babel/core ^8.0.1` (all majors). The `splash` failure is a real Expo-config migration (top-level `splash` was removed from `ExpoConfig`; it now lives under the `expo-splash-screen` config plugin). **Disposition: held for manual review** (major/breaking SDK upgrade = human decision, not a mechanical fix-forward). Branch left in place; not merged, not deleted. To adopt: regenerate the lockfile, migrate `app.config.ts` `splash` → `expo-splash-screen` plugin config, then re-run dnd-app mobile CI. Surfaced to Gavin via the board this run.
